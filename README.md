## üìù Model Overview

This model is a **DistilBERT-based legal clause classifier** fine-tuned on the **LexGLUE‚ÄìLEDGAR** dataset.  
It predicts the **type of contract clause** (e.g., *Confidentiality*, *Termination*, *Liability*, *Payment*, etc.) given a legal paragraph or clause.

- **Base Model:** `distilbert-base-uncased`  
- **Dataset:** `coastalcph/lex_glue` (`ledgar` configuration)  
- **Task Type:** Multi-class text classification  
- **Language:** English  
- **Domain:** Legal / Contractual Texts  

This model achieves **strong performance** despite its small size, making it efficient for deployment in legal NLP systems and agentic AI applications.

How to use it:

from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline("text-classification", model="SalmanAbbasi/lexglue-ledgar-distilbert")

text = "This clause sets out the obligations of each party regarding confidentiality."
print(pipe(text))


## üìö Dataset ‚Äî LexGLUE LEDGAR

The **LEDGAR** dataset contains contract clauses annotated with one of **100+ provision types**.  
It is part of the [LexGLUE benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/coastalcph/lex_glue), which evaluates legal text understanding models.

Each sample includes:
